# Algebraic Structures

Albegraic structures are a powerful toolset for dealing with not only mathematical problems but real-world research problems in that they are capable of modeling things or categories that share the *same* behavior. Groups, for example, can be used to describe a set of things that have addition operator defined where there exists a zero element such that $0 + g = g = g + 0, \forall g \in \mathbb{G}$.

In the context of data analysis where data is typically organized as tables, or data frames, we can also embed these representations to some algebraic structures like rings, modules, etc. A paper from PODS'07 already showcased the possibility of doing so. In fact, the relational algebra can be deemed as operators defined on the structures and the data itself can be seen as elements in the set. Thus, if we have correctly defined what operations the query should take and how does the data table look like, we can model the data using abstract models. This simplifies the complexity of real-world data analysis behavior. In more detail, since a table consists of rows, to embed this into algebraic structure from where the 'annontations', a separate column for the table, come from. These annotations serve as some sepcial marks that determine the properties of rows.
