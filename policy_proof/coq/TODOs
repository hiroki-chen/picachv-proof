[x] Refactor the `normalize`-related functionalities; perhaps we do not really
need them. They are solely for the purposes of applying a dummy identity
function to each column, but we can certainly implement this when pattern
matching the `project_column` constructor.
[x] Add the proof obligation for `simple_atomic_expression`'s constructor when we construct a column type.
[ ] Add policy clauses like below

  ```
    redact ∨ remove ∧ generalize
  ```
