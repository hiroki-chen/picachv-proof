[x] Refactor the `normalize`-related functionalities; perhaps we do not really
need them. They are solely for the purposes of applying a dummy identity
function to each column, but we can certainly implement this when pattern
matching the `project_column` constructor.
[x] Add the proof obligation for `simple_atomic_expression`'s constructor when we construct a column type.
<!-- [ ] Add policy clauses like below

  ```
    redact ∨ remove ∧ generalize
  ``` -->

[x] modify the definition of `flowsto`.

[x] Breaking change: we modify all functions into relations so that we make the semantics more consistent.

apply_proj_in_env -> apply_proj_in_env_slice -> apply_proj_in_relation -> apply_proj_elem -> apply_unary_function_in_relation -> do_apply_unary_function -> apply_unary_function_in_cell

[x] Fix `security.v`
[ ] Implement join for policy-related data structures.
[x] Implement select's semantics.
[ ] It seems that noise should be the policy at the aggregation level.
